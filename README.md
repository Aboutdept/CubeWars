## How to use
You can clone the repo and open the project with the Unreal Editor. If you want to start the project from your Visual Studio environment make sure you have the Unreal Engine installed and then right click the project file *CubeWars.uproject*. Look for the "Generate Visual Studio Project Files" option and click it. Now Unreal should create your *CubeWars.sln*.

## About the Game
This game can only be played with 2 players. Each player takes controller over a cube that is able to slide to the right(Via [A] and [D]) and left, but cannot move forth nor back. A player may also rotate their cube using the mouse and fire with the left mouse button. The first player that reaches 0 health loses the match. To make things more interesting there are moveable barriers between the players to block theis shots, but they can destroy them.
